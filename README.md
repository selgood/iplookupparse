# Track IP locations in a simple view.
A dirty little IP lookup and parser from IP logs made for fun. Displays a basic lookup of IP addresses and displays them flat out in the console and can output to a file.

Requires geoip2

> pip install geoip2

Supply a file to search through or supply a single IP address, make sure you have an IP Geo Database in your Python Path. (Currently only supports Windows.)
